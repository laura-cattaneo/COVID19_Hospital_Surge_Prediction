# COVID19_Hospital_Surge_Prediction

I participated in the [2021 University of Minnesota Health Data Competition](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/health-data-competition) with two Master in Business Analytics classmates, and two Biostatistics PhD Candidates.
The topic we chose was 'Hospital Surge Prediction using Google Trends'. 
I learned how to use the google trends API and expanded my experience in Machine Learning by exploring the predictive performance of various models.
